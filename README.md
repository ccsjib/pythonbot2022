Welcome to jib's NASA bot :)

This bot connects to the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API to pull the picture along with all relevant information. It can send different pieces of info based on a user's reaction to the message, keeping chat from clogging up. 

Commands:

"nasa" - Pings the user + sends title along with APOD. Displays a message with reactions that can be used as buttons to obtain an image description and date.
